Will write a code for the idea.
First version in python and a second version in C++.


Description of Project:

The Hotel Management Project aims at keeping the student records and attendance information of each student in the hotel along with their hotel number details and room number.

The system also calculates the food bills of each student after they take the food provided by the hotel’s MESS department. Overall, the project aims at making easy accommodation and calculation procedure for Hotel Management.


Existing System:

The current hotel management system is a manual one where most of the management-related things are done without using a computer. This system is not able to keep records of the hotel students who are not present in their room during the night time.

This demerit has been solved in the proposed system with the provision of fine or any other appropriate actions against those who are absent in their hotel room during night.

Another disadvantage of the current system is the MESS payment procedure. Here, hotel students have to make full monthly payment for the food even if they do not eat on particular day for various reasons. The attendance in MESS as well as in all hotels are done manually by counting heads of each student.


Proposed System:

In this Hotel Management software, students are at first allocated to their appropriate hotel during the admission. The MESS food charges are additional, so the hotelers who eat food pay for the exact amount. This means, if any hoteler is not present, they don’t have to pay for the food for that particular day.

The key features of Hotel Management System are listed below:

    Each hoteler is provided a unique id during the admission time.
    They system keeps track of each and every hoteler by that unique id.
    The system can be used to find the vacant rooms if the hotel is very big. It can also be used to find the total numbers of rooms in the hotel, and the students residing in a particular hotel room.
    The system displays information regarding the hotel room for boys and girls.
    Hotel number can be assigned on the basis of year of admission and the course taken by the hoteler.

In addition to the aforementioned features, an admin can keep track of data of each and every employee working in the hotel. These employees, like the hotel students, are given unique id number. The admin can see list of all employees working in the hotel; they can add, edit, delete various information such as MESS charges, hotel charges, etc.
